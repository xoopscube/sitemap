    <h2>What is a sitemap?</h2></th>

    <p>A <strong>sitemap</strong> is a list of pages that are contained in a website
    that is accessible to website crawlers or users.
    It can vary in type—sometimes it may be a simple document used as a planning tool for designing the website,
    or it may be a web page that contains a list of all pages within a website, which is generally organized in
    a hierarchical way. Sitemaps display the relationship between various pages and content of a website,
    demonstrating the way that the website is organized, how it can be navigated, and how it is labeled.
    There are a few different types of sitemaps, and a few different styles of sitemaps.
    Both of these factors will vary simply based on who or what the sitemap is intended for.</p>

    <h2>TYPES OF SITEMAPS</h2>
    <p>Visual sitemaps, XML sitemaps, and HTML sitemaps all provide different benefits and make a website great
    when they are all used together and cohesively. While the 3 types of sitemaps are used for distinctly different
    purposes, the best outcome will be had when all 3 are employed and are created with full effort.
    Using all 3 kinds of sitemaps will help to ensure that the website contains all of the basic information
    and content that is intended, but that it also functions successfully to provide a great user experience as
    they are browsing the website and looking for the information that is provided.
    Sitemaps also act as comparison points for various checkpoints in the life-cycle of a website.</p>


    <h3>Visual sitemap</h3>
    <p>Visual sitemaps are used mostly as a planning tool that will help webmasters to organize and sort the content
    that will be included on the website, and helps to eliminate any pages that may be unnecessary.
    When doing this, a visual sitemap allows the webmaster to outline the purpose and goal of the website
    to be focused and easy to navigate, which will provide a great user experience to the website visitors.
    Visual sitemaps are ideal for when the webmaster is planning the project, managing it through the process,
    and maintaining it after it has been completed. Is it absolutely vital to have a visual sitemap in order
    to have a successful website? It is difficult to say, but having a visual sitemap is just one factor in
    the length of time that it takes to see success for a website. It is a great planning tool that comes
    in hand for every step of the way in building a website.<br>
    The module Sitemap can be used to show only the specified modules and sub-categories in preferences.</p>


    <h3>XML sitemap</h3>
    <p>XML sitemaps are structured in a way that the user does not need to see, but its purpose is to inform the
    search engines about the pages that are on the website, relates their importance to each other, as well as
    how often they are updated. The thought behind XML sitemaps is that some websites are made up of a large
    amount of pages that are only accessible through user entries and forms (think Amazon).
    This sitemap will contain URLs to all of the individual pages so that they can be found by web crawlers.
    This type of sitemap is much more precise than others—syntax must be exact because errors are absolutely
    not tolerated. An XML sitemap ensures that all nooks and crannies of a website are available to be crawled
    and indexed, so that they can be found by search engines when relevant search queries are performed.
    This expands the chance that a website will show up in a search engine results page (SERP),
    reaching more users than without showing up on the SERP. The module Sitemap file: xml_google.php</p>


    <h3>HTML sitemap</h3>
    <p>HTML sitemaps are designed with the user in mind, to help them find content on the web page. Because of this,
    the HTML sitemaps do not need to include every single subpage on the website. An HTML sitemap helps both
    website visitors and search engine bots to find web pages within a website. It should be noted that this
    format is not supported by Google's Webmaster Tools, thus it cannot be submitted. This is purely for the
    user experience, front end portion, and website search. This is a component of the XCL module that can be customized:
        modules/sitemap/templates/sitemap_index.html.</p>
    <p>Note: The module sitemap also features a block (template) that can be expanded.</p>
